    <p>
        The beginning seed of this theatre piece all started when my wonderful advisor and professor, Malinda Palani,
        spoke the words Opheliamachine to me one cold and snowy day in February last year. Referencing the play by
        Heiner Mueller, she wondered what it would be like to devise a similar ecologically conscious play, but one
        focusing on the minor female character, Hamlet’s lover, Ophelia. At the time, I did not expect this idea to
        blossom, but, for some reason, the words never left my mind - they rang and sounded and grew until they expanded
        into the foliage of words, sounds and movement which you will see on this shoreline today. I believe that the
        classics, holding prominent cultural capital in America, are one of the best tools we can use as artists to talk
        about prominent and sensitive issues in our society, as they offer a metaphor, a parallel world, in which to
        examine our own. Inspired by Shakespeare’s natural imagery, we have reimagined our relationship with the earth
        as a romantic one, where corruption, neglect, ignorance and greed turn each of us against her who supports us
        the most. Thank you for coming to our show and we hope you enjoy returning to the world of live theatre!
