        <p>When choosing this space, I originally referenced it as “that lawn in front of the sculpture by the
            Recreation Center.” I had no idea that this beautiful piece of art was a memorial to all the students who
            lost their lives while enrolled at Carleton College. It was created as a place to honor the lives of each
            individual student and to offer a place of self reflection for the Carleton community for the years to come.
            If you have never been up to and with the Student Memorial in the past, as I had never done, please take a
            moment at the start or end of this production to look closer, reading the names of those who lost their
            lives on each ring. We are grateful to share this space with this Memorial and the memory of those students
            who are gone. We ask ourselves and you that we all may bring respect and acknowledgement into this place,
            and remember those who have come before and those who will come long after. Thank you.
